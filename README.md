# home-assistant-achievements

This is a prototype to have a system of achievements in Home Assistant.

* Short term goal: expose interesting patterns of an HA instance represented as achievements.
* Long term goal: offer a system for any integration to expose achievements easily thanks to helper provided by this repository.
* All time goal: have fun and pride with useless trivia about an HA instance
